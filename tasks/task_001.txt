# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Rust Project Repository
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new Rust project with Cargo, set up basic directory structure, and add initial dependencies (e.g., serde, serde_json, PyO3, maturin).
# Details:
Run `cargo new cypher-guard`. Add dependencies to Cargo.toml. Set up src/lib.rs and src/main.rs. Initialize a README and .gitignore.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds with `cargo build` and runs basic tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Rust Project with Cargo [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Rust project named 'cypher-guard' using Cargo and set up the basic project structure.
### Details:
Run `cargo new cypher-guard --lib` to create a library project. This will generate the initial project structure with Cargo.toml, src/lib.rs, and .gitignore. Then create src/main.rs manually for the binary component of the project.

## 2. Configure Project Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add and configure all required dependencies in the Cargo.toml file, including serialization libraries and Python bindings.
### Details:
Edit Cargo.toml to add the following dependencies: serde with derive feature, serde_json for JSON serialization, PyO3 for Python bindings, and maturin for building Python packages. Include version specifications for each dependency. Also set up appropriate crate type configurations for library usage.

## 3. Create Project Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up comprehensive documentation for the project including README.md with usage instructions and project overview.
### Details:
Create a README.md file with sections for: project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. Include information about the purpose of the cypher-guard library and how it integrates with both Rust and Python projects.

## 4. Implement Basic Library Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up the foundational code structure in src/lib.rs with module declarations and public API definitions.
### Details:
In src/lib.rs, define the module structure for the project. Create placeholder functions and types that will form the public API. If using PyO3, add the necessary module and function annotations for Python exports. Implement basic error types and result wrappers that will be used throughout the codebase.

## 5. Configure Version Control and CI Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Enhance the .gitignore file and set up initial continuous integration configuration.
### Details:
Expand the default .gitignore to include project-specific patterns like build artifacts, IDE files, and Python-specific ignores if using PyO3. Create a basic CI configuration file (e.g., for GitHub Actions) that builds the project, runs tests, and checks formatting. Initialize the git repository with `git init` and make an initial commit with the project structure.
