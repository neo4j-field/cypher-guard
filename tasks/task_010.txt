# Task ID: 10
# Title: Task #10: Build Custom Cypher Parser in Rust
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a custom Cypher parser in Rust that can validate syntax and generate Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for Cypher queries, providing a foundation for advanced query processing capabilities.
# Details:
The implementation should follow these steps:

1. Research and analyze the Cypher query language grammar specification to understand its structure and syntax rules.
2. Choose an appropriate parsing approach - consider using parser combinators (e.g., nom crate) or parser generators (e.g., LALRPOP, pest).
3. Define the AST data structures that will represent parsed Cypher queries, ensuring they capture all necessary semantic information.
4. Implement the parser incrementally:
   - Start with basic constructs like MATCH, WHERE, and RETURN clauses
   - Add support for pattern matching and path expressions
   - Implement property access and filtering expressions
   - Add support for more complex features like aggregations, ordering, and subqueries
5. Implement robust error handling with meaningful error messages that include position information.
6. Ensure the parser integrates with the existing validation functions from previous tasks.
7. Document the parser's API and internal structure thoroughly.
8. Optimize the parser for performance, especially for large and complex queries.

The parser should be designed as a separate module within the project structure, with clear interfaces for other components to use. Consider future extensibility for features like query optimization and transformation.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit tests for each parser component:
   - Test individual grammar rules and AST node generation
   - Verify correct parsing of all Cypher clause types
   - Test error handling for malformed queries

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify that the parser works correctly with the existing validation functions
   - Test end-to-end parsing of complex queries into complete ASTs

3. Property-based testing:
   - Generate random valid Cypher queries and verify they parse correctly
   - Generate invalid queries and verify appropriate error messages

4. Benchmark tests:
   - Measure parsing performance for queries of varying complexity
   - Establish performance baselines for future optimization

5. Regression tests:
   - Create a test suite with examples of all supported Cypher constructs
   - Ensure that adding new features doesn't break existing functionality

6. Edge case testing:
   - Test queries with nested expressions and complex patterns
   - Verify handling of all Cypher literal types and operators

Document all test cases and their coverage to ensure the parser handles the full range of Cypher syntax correctly.
